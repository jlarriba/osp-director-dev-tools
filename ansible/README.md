# openstack-k8s/ansible

#### Provisioning steps

##### Provision the host

Provision a host with RHEL 8.2 or CentOS should also work with at least 128GB of RAM


##### Install Dependencies

If not already installed, install the required dependencies

```
dnf install -y ansible git libvirt-client python3-netaddr python3-lxml
```

##### Clone the repository to the beaker host

The ansible playbooks can be used as any user, but this user needs to be able to
get root privileges to the host via passwordless sudo.

```
ssh root@<node>
git clone https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/osp-director-dev-tools.git
```

##### Modify the variable files

Modify `ansible/vars/default.yaml` to meet your req.

##### Create local-defaults.yaml file with personal information

Create `local-defaults.yaml` file with a setting for `ci_token`
or export CI_TOKEN shell variable in your environment.

You can get ci_token from https://console-openshift-console.apps.ci.l2s4.p1.openshiftapps.com/
by clicking on your name in the top right corner and coping the login
command (the token is part of the command)

`local-defaults.yaml` has the min format:

```
ci_token: <TOKEN>
```

If using CI_TOKEN as shell variable, which has precedence over
`local-defaults.yaml` use:

```
export CI_TOKEN: <TOKEN>
```

Additionally create the following files relative to the
project root:

`vars/rhel-subscription.yaml` is optional. If the file is not created, it will try to use your current subscription to add the corresponding repositories:

```
rhel_subscription_activation_key: xyz
rhel_subscription_org_id: "123123123"
```

`files/pull-secret` which contains your OCP pull-secrets file.

Any other parameter from `vars/default.yaml` can be customized using
`local-defaults.yaml`. Add parameters to meet your req.

You may and the optionally add a `secrets_repo` setting to your `local-defaults.yaml`.
NOTE: `secrets_repo` is optional, if unset the above files must be manually copied
into place inside this project.

##### Install all steps using the Makefile

There is a Makefile which runs all the steps per default

```
dnf install -y make
cd osp-director-dev-tools/ansible
make
```

**Note**
prepare_host.yaml will delete the home lvs and grow the root partition to max.
In case there is data stored on /home, make a backup!

##### When installation finished

On the local system add the required entries to your local /etc/hosts. The previous used ansible playbook also outputs the information:

```
cat <<EOF >> /etc/hosts
192.168.111.4   console-openshift-console.apps.ostest.test.metalkube.org console openshift-authentication-openshift-authentication.apps.ostest.test.metalkube.org api.ostest.test.metalkube.org prometheus-k8s-openshift-monitoring.apps.ostest.test.metalkube.org alertmanager-main-openshift-monitoring.apps.ostest.test.metalkube.org kubevirt-web-ui.apps.ostest.test.metalkube.org oauth-openshift.apps.ostest.test.metalkube.org grafana-openshift-monitoring.apps.ostest.test.metalkube.org
EOF
```

##### Access OCP
**Note**
The cluster name is used in the hostname records, where `ostest` is the default in dev-scripts.
Update the above example to use the cluster name set in the vars file.

To access OCP console

On the local system, enable SSH proxying:
```
# on Fedora
sudo dnf install sshuttle

# on RHEL
sudo pip install sshuttle

sshuttle -r <user>@<virthost> 192.168.111.0/24 192.168.25.0/24
```

Now you can access the OCP console using your local web browser: <https://console-openshift-console.apps.ostest.test.metalkube.org>

User: `kubeadmin`
Pwd: `/home/ocp/dev-scripts/ocp/ostest/auth/kubeadmin-password`

```
su - ocp
export KUBECONFIG=/home/ocp/dev-scripts/ocp/ostest/auth/kubeconfig
oc get pods -n openstack
```

##### Install OSP

The ansible playbook generates the scaffolding needed for tripleo to deploy OpenStack. The actual OpenStack installation need to be triggered manually
```
oc exec -it -n openstack openstackclient /home/cloud-admin/deploy_tripleo.sh
```

##### Access OSP
You can also access the OSP console using your local web browser: <http://192.168.25.100>

User: `admin`
Pwd: The admin password can be found in the `/home/cloud-admin/tripleo-deploy/tripleo-overcloud-passwords.yaml` file on the `openstackclient` pod in the `openstack` namespace.
```
oc exec -it openstackclient -- cat /home/cloud-admin/tripleo-deploy/tripleo-overcloud-passwords.yaml | grep -w AdminPassword
```

#### Cleanup full env:

```
make cleanup
```

#### Other possible cleanup steps

##### Delete ocp env only

```
make destroy_ocp
```

##### Delete OSP controllers
TODO:
```
make ocp_controller_cleanup
```

##### Tempest to run functional test

Create a tempest pod in OCP to run it. Tempest run is triggerd in an initContainer that we can wait
for the "normal" pod container which just runs a sleep to come up in ready state.

```
make osp_tests_run
```

Tempest can be controlled via vars in default.yaml file to be:
* enabled/disabled (default enabled)
  tempest_enabled: true/false
* tempest timeout in seconds to wait for the pod to come up:
  tempest_timeout: 1200
* tests to run, either empty array, which then triggers smoke test
  or a specified whitelist
  tempest_whitelist: []
  tempest_whitelist:
  - aaa
  - bbb
